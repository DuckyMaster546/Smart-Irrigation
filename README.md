# Smart Irrigation System with Arduino Uno

This project implements a smart irrigation system using an Arduino Uno. The system uses temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors to monitor environmental conditions and control water pumps accordingly. The data is displayed on an LCD screen.

## Features
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Reads temperature using a temperature sensor.
- **Humidity Monitoring**: Reads humidity using a humidity sensor.
- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Reads soil moisture levels using a soil moisture sensor.
- **Automated Pump Control**: Controls water pumps based on soil moisture levels.
- **LCD Display**: Displays temperature, humidity, and soil moisture status on an LCD.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- Temperature Sensor (e.g., DHT11, DHT22)
- Humidity Sensor (e.g., DHT11, DHT22)
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- LCD Display (I2C)
- Water Pumps
- Relay Module
- Connecting Wires

## Wiring Diagram
(Include a wiring diagram image or description here)

## Setup and Usage
1. Connect the sensors and pumps to the Arduino Uno as per the wiring diagram.
2. Upload the provided code to the Arduino Uno.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to view the sensor readings.
4. The LCD will display the current temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels. The pumps will turn on or off based on the soil moisture readings.
