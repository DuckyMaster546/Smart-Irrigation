# Smart Irrigation System with Arduino Uno

This project implements a smart irrigation system using an Arduino Uno. The system uses temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors to monitor environmental conditions and control water pumps accordingly. The data is displayed on an LCD screen.

## Features
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Reads temperature using a temperature sensor.
- **Humidity Monitoring**: Reads humidity using a humidity sensor.
- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Reads soil moisture levels using a soil moisture sensor.
- **Automated Pump Control**: Controls water pumps based on soil moisture levels.
- **LCD Display**: Displays temperature, humidity, and soil moisture status on an LCD.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- Temperature Sensor (e.g., DHT11, DHT22)
- Humidity Sensor (e.g., DHT11, DHT22)
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- LCD Display (I2C)
- Water Pumps
- Relay Module
- Connecting Wires
